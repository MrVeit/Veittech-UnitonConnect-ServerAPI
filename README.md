# UNITON CONNECT - API SERVER

Implementation of a simple API for [Uniton Connect library](https://github.com/MrVeit/Veittech-UnitonConnect) that loads WebP and other web-specific image formats from a link (relevant for NFT collections) and gives them to a web application on Unity in jpeg/png formats.
